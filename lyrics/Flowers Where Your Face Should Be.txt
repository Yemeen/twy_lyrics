Flowers Where Your Face Should Be

-------------------------------

Bright blue hydrangeas 
 Lost in the weeds 
 Bus stops and barbed wire on the way to stare 
 At the heart of the earth from the Poas peak 
 Just like the ones that we grew back in Jersey 
 Hung upside down, drying out for the wedding 
 There's a man with his head in his hands on the sidewalk 
 His wife's there behind him just off of the street 
 She scratches his back as he sobs on the asphalt 
 And what strikes me most is the symmetry 
 How they're framed just like you and me 
 When the light from the hospital's eastern wing 
 Tangles up in your hair and the sadness that pooled in my heart 
 Starts emptying slowly 
 Well I saw you last night in my dream 
 And there were hydrangeas where your face should be 
 The redwoods feel lonely and lunar and distant 
 The sun comes in fragments through breaks in the trees 
 And I feel further from home than I've ever been 
 These thin lines of light across space tether you to me 
 They pull in my memories, back to our apartment on 2nd Street 
 Through the South-facing window the light catches lengths of your hair 
 Like a path that you left me 
 Well I saw you last night in my dream 
 But there were azaleas where your face should be 
 Pieces of us in the morning sun 
 Sleeping bags under the 101 
 She takes off his glasses and she falls asleep again 
 They don't got much but goddamn they got love 
 Well I saw you last night in my dream 
 I'm gonna marry you underneath driftwood from Crescent City
