You're Not Salinger. Get Over It.

-------------------------------

We're finding out some scummy fuck 
 Just threw it in a fifteen year old 
 I mean come on, man, is that the life you want? 
 They're tearing up these dead-end blocks 
 Revealing all the shit we wish we forgot 
 In the shadow of this careless urban sprawl 
 My friends and I, we're all fucked on the inside 
 My friends and I, we're all fucked on the inside 
 My friends and I, we're all fucked on the inside 
 But we don't let it run our lives 
 One day, I'll cough all of this shit out of my lungs 
 From second hand smoking all night restaurants 
 And they'll be up in arms over all the shit we've done 
 Because we're getting out, we're fucking gone 
 This caustic suburban sense of humor's gotten me in trouble more than a few times 
 We're singing "Lucky" by Little League, fucking up until we get this right 
 Just 'cause we're down, doesn't mean we've gotta stay there 
 This fucking town is like a ship gone underwater 
 And we'll all drown unless we cut ties to the anchor 
 We'd get swallowed here 
 One day, I'll cough all of this shit out of my lungs 
 From second hand smoking all night restaurants 
 And they'll be up in arms over all the shit we've done 
 Because we're getting out, we're fucking gone 
 (So chin up and we'll drown a little slower, hey) 
 'Cause I'm bad at staying calm 
 (So chin up and we'll drown a little slower, hey) 
 (So chin up and we'll drown a little slower, hey) 
 And I know this town's a time bomb 
 (So chin up and we'll drown a little slower, hey) 
 (So chin up and we'll drown a little slower, hey) 
 And we've been dragging our feet 
 (So chin up and we'll drown a little slower, hey) 
 Too long, too long 
 (So chin up and we'll drown a little slower, hey) 
 We've been sinking all along 
 (So chin up and we'll drown a little slower, hey) 
 (So chin up and we'll drown a little slower, hey) 
 And we're gone 
 (So chin up and we'll drown a little slower, hey) 
 And we're gone 
 (So chin up and we'll drown a little slower, hey) 
 And we're gone 
 (So chin up, so chin up) 
 One day, I'll cough all of this shit out of my lungs 
 From second hand smoking all night restaurants 
 And they'll be up in arms over all the shit we've done 
 Because we're getting out
