Through Two Hearts

-------------------------------

I woke this morning, and drew up a list 
 Of all my sad moments, and people I miss 
 As dawn turns the sky blue 
 Sadly without you 
 And I'll make my own earth 
 At night while I rest 
 To go to Australia 
 And avenge your death 
 I'll find that stingray 
 And make sure it's last breath's today 
 I read the news today 
 It seems Australians have been mangling stingrays 
 I guess they feel like me 
 'Cause man we really miss you, Steve 
 You've got a barb through the heart 
 And I felt it too 
 I can't believe that this world would take you 
 And when I miss you and I'm lonely, Steve 
 I don't know what to do 
 You've got a barb through the heart 
 And slowly went under 
 What an awful way to finish the summer 
 When I miss you or I'm lonely, Steve 
 I just watch Crocodile Hunter 
 And I saw the news today 
 They had you and your son on instant replay 
 Just cause you let him play with crocodiles 
 Doesn't make you a bad role model 
 I woke this morning, and drew up a list 
 Of all my sad moments, and people I miss 
 As dawn turns the sky blue 
 It's damn eyes are at you 
 You've got a barb through the heart 
 And I felt it too 
 I can't believe that this world would take you 
 And when I miss you and I'm lonely, Steve 
 I don't know what to do 
 You've got a barb through the heart 
 And slowly went under 
 What an awful way to finish the summer 
 When I miss you or I'm lonely, Steve 
 I just watch Crocodile Hunter
