Solo & Chewy

-------------------------------

I've been trying to think about anything but this 
 Or how we're missing towns, we're missing out, the exit's on this strip 
 I've been wondering how or if we'll ever get to sleep 
 Because we're sixteen hours in 
 This ride from Eric's house has been fucking up my shit 
 Because we stayed to watch the weeks new Office 
 And now it's twelve AM in the dirty south 
 You know we must be bored of this 
 Because we're stealing from gas stations and talking about how 
 Arizona's airport is called Sky Harbor 
 I wonder if that's what the last song on Clarity's about 
 We're saying it loud 
 Get to the Falcon, it's three AM and we're delirious 
 Cheating on the Atlantic 
 We're talking about pawning all our shit 
 Buying wave runners and becoming pirates 
 And we've been falling apart; like Richie's got a brand new stretch mark 
 Night drives start at Waffle House and end at Walmart 
 We're breaking hearts of waitresses in seedy truck stops 
 Because Steve's shirtless, pounding beers in the parking lot 
 We're taking naked pictures in the Utah desert 
 "Yo man, I think that girl just saw your dick" 
 We're saying it loud 
 Get to the Falcon, it's three AM and we're delirious 
 Cheating on the Atlantic 
 We're talking about pawning all our shit 
 Buying wave runners and becoming pirates 
 If this is our time, the Denver Skyline 
 Is telling me to make up my god-damn mind 
 If this is our time, the Denver Skyline 
 Is telling me to make up my god-damn mind 
 (I've been trying to think about anything but this) 
 If this is our time, the Denver Skyline 
 (Or how we're missing towns, we're missing out, the exit's on this strip) 
 Is telling me to make up my god-damn mind 
 (I've been wondering how or if we'll ever get to sleep) 
 If this is our time, the Denver Skyline 
 (Because we're sixteen hours in) 
 Is telling me to make up my god-damn mind
