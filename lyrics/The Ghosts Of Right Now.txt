The Ghosts Of Right Now

-------------------------------

I wanna take you someplace safer 
 Pull your pain out with my teeth 
 I wanna take away the ulcers burning holes into your cheeks 
 And I wanna bring you back to water, turn your branches evergreen 
 I wanna take you someplace safer 
 I wanna leave 
 I wanted to see how the light collects in the high desert heat 
 And you point to where the South Sister should be behind the clouds 
 I'm haunted by the ghosts of right now 
 The entire coast is out of water 
 It's turning different shades of grey 
 Like watching somebody you love 
 As they slowly waste away 
 And you looked skinny at my wedding 
 Sick of carrying the weight 
 Of all the doctors and all the treatments and all the reasons to be afraid 
 I wanted to see how the light collects in the high desert heat 
 And you point to where the South Sister should be behind the clouds 
 I'm haunted by the ghosts of right now 
 The ghosts of right now 
 I wanna take you someplace safer 
 I wanna take you someplace safer 
 I wanted to see how the light collects in the high desert heat 
 And you point to where the South Sister should be behind the clouds 
 I'm haunted by the ghosts of right now
