Chaser

-------------------------------

When you clear out all the smoke, the memories of those years seem dimly lit like I never replaced a light bulb. 
 When you clear out all the smoke, they found me on your neighbor's lawn, rambling on, dizzy and upset and freezing cold. 
 I know how it looked when I fell to pieces around you. 
 I'm a chaser but I found stronger winds. If you believe her, there's no going home again. 
 I'm a chaser but I found stronger winds. 
 If you believe her, there's no going home. I'm not going home. 
 I got suckered in. Please, don't make me feel like a disaster. 
 I'm learning how to put the pieces back together and turn the aching to composure. 
 I'm thinking with my head first; no more broken phones or swollen knuckles from putting holes in the booth by the back wall. 
 When you clear out all the smoke, I guess everyone's alone. 
 When you clear out all the smoke, I don't see why that's so wrong.
