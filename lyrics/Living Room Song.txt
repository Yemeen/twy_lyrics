Living Room Song

-------------------------------

Guy on the radio sounds like a budget Stephen Hawking 
 Keeps trying to tell that the bible says the world is ending 
 It goes down around May 20th so I guess this song is pointless you're never gonna hear it 
 But if the world ends, I hope I'm in my living room with best friends, so raise your glasses 
 We don't have trouble sleepin' no one, no one's gonna take that away from me 
 We don't have trouble sleepin' we know, we know who we wanna be 
 Fuck some movie that I swore Keanu Reeves was in 
 These doomsday prophecies are all gonna amount to nothing 
 And so for now I'm callin' bullshit the Mayan's don't believe it. Why should I be any different? 
 But if the world ends, I hope I'm in my living room with good friends, so raise your glasses 
 We don't have trouble sleepin' no one, no one's gonna take that away from me 
 We don't have trouble sleepin' we know, we know who we wanna be 
 And this week is gonna swallow me, but when it spits me out I'm landing on my feet 
 I'm going to bed tonight, in my New Found Glory hoodie. 
 So fuck the world and what it wants me to be So fuck the world and what it wants me to be 
 So fuck the world... 
 We don't have trouble sleepin' no one, no one's gonna take that away from me 
 We don't have trouble sleepin' we know, we know who we wanna be 
 We don't have trouble sleepin' no one, no one's gonna take that away from me 
 We don't have trouble sleepin' we know, we know who we wanna be 
 We don't have trouble sleepin' no one, no one's gonna take that away from me 
 We don't have trouble sleepin' we know, we know who we wanna be
