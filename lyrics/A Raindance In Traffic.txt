A Raindance In Traffic

-------------------------------

I'm fanaticizing about doing a raindance in traffic. 
 I'm fanaticizing about a storm to wash me away. 
 If you'd study the laugh-lines, you'd see that I'm cracking. 
 I spent six months now feeling like dead weight-the fighter in me must have died a long time ago. 
 I must have been watching his ghost; just going through the motions, just putting on a face. 
 It feels like 1929 and I'm on the verge of a great collapse today. 
 Every window in this house faces a brick wall. 
 I'm panicked and absent like a bird in a cage. 
 The word from the front lines says that we're out-gunned but I can't walk away. 
 No, I can't walk away. No, I can't. 
 I was just happy to be a contender. I was just aching for anything. 
 I used to have such steady hands, now I can't keep them from shaking.
