Cigarettes & Saints

-------------------------------

Twice a week, I pass by the church that held your funeral 
 And the pastor's words come pouring down like rain 
 How he called you a sinner but said now you walk with Jesus 
 So the drugs that took your life aren't gonna cause you any pain 
 I don't think he even knew your name 
 And I refused to kneel or pray, I won't remember you that way 
 But I lit you a candle in every cathedral across Europe 
 And I hope you know you're still my patron saint 
 Well, I try to forgive but I can't forget the cigar in his fist 
 Oh, I know that they were heartsick, but I need someone to blame 
 And I know how they blame me, I know what you'd say 
 You'd tell me it was your fault, I should put all my arrows away 
 Well, I'm sure there ain't a heaven 
 But that don't mean I don't like to picture you there 
 I bet you're bumming cigarettes off saints 
 And I'm sure you're still singing 
 But I'll bet that you're still just a bit out of key 
 With that crooked smile pushing words across your teeth 
 'Cause you were heat lightning 
 Yeah, you were a storm that never rolled in 
 You were the northern lights in a southern town 
 A caustic fleeting thing 
 I'll bury your memories in the garden 
 I'll watch 'em grow with the flowers in the spring 
 I'll keep you with me 
 These wolves in their suits and ties 
 Saying, "Kid, you can trust me" 
 Charming southern drawl, sunken eyes 
 Buying good will in hotel lobbies 
 Got fistfuls of pills to make sure you don't hurt no more 
 You don't gotta feel anything 
 Got their fangs in our veins 
 Got their voice in our head 
 Got our arms in their grips 
 No, we can't shake free 
 This god-damn machine; hungry and heartless 
 My whole generation got lost in the margin 
 We put our faith in you; you turned a profit 
 Now we're drowning here under your waves 
 (There's no failures when we can't see the problems) 
 Drowning held under your waves 
 (There's no failures when we can't see the problems) 
 Drowning here, drowning here 
 You can't have my friends, you can't have my brothers 
 You can't have my friends, you can't have my brothers 
 You can't have my friends, you can't have my brothers 
 You can't have me, no, you can't have me
