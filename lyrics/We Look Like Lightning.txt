We Look Like Lightning

-------------------------------

I forgot what month it is again 
 I'm half awake 
 I know it's wrong but I swear to God it's almost Christmas 
 In a language I don't understand 
 There's a shaking voice on the PA 
 The other passengers seem nervous 
 I'm playing- 
 What song do you want to die to? 
 What song do you... 
 I'm suddenly aware of our speed 
 Sew the world together tightly 
 Cinch the gaps with pins and string 
 And the beacon out there on the wing 
 It lights the clouds from inside out 
 And from the ground we look like lightning 
 I'm playing- 
 What song do you want to die to? 
 What song do you... 
 I'm everywhere at once again 
 I hear the ocean in the engine 
 I feel the moonlight creeping in 
 Maybe it's all in my head 
 An unknown foreign presence in your bloodstream 
 I'm a stranger in my bed 
 I'm playing 
 What song do you want to die to? 
 What song do you want to die to? 
 What song do you want to die to? 
 What song do you? 
 I'm flashing back to us one night in a prairie town 
 (Tornado alley, outrunning a storm) 
 They can see the dirt there under my fingernails 
 (I'm just a pile of bones left on an airport floor) 
 The bags under my eyes have got space when you bottom out 
 (To pack your things and make a break for the door) 
 One day the things you love are gonna put you in the ground 
 (But I'm planning on running till I can't anymore) 
 What song do you, want to die to? 
 What song do you, want to die to? 
 What song do you, want to die to? 
 What song do you? 
 What song do you? 
 What song do you?
