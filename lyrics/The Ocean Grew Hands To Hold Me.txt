The Ocean Grew Hands To Hold Me

-------------------------------

I stopped making deals with God 
 Right around when you left 
 I said that I would start believing 
 If they made you well again 
 Guess they knew it was bullshit 
 Never hold up my end 
 All the walls are stained in your nicotine 
 I could feel closing in 
 I heard somebody cry 
 I thought I was alone 
 I came to numb my lungs in the salt air 
 Let the breakers heal my bones 
 I wish that the current would carry me home 
 I've been running for a decade now 
 And I think I'm ready to go 
 Oh, I'm ready to go 
 I stopped making deals with God 
 When the light finally died 
 I'm gonna guard what's left of the good in us 
 When the ash blocks out the sky 
 And hold you with my left hand 
 And ball up my right 
 And if the bastards come for both of us 
 I'll be right there by your side 
 I'm by your side 
 When I was in shambles 
 When I got too weak 
 The ocean grew hands to hold me 
 When I was in shambles 
 When I got too weak 
 The ocean grew hands to hold me 
 I stopped blaming God 
 When you said you were sick 
 I learned to lean on the people who love me 
 When the sutures start to split 
 I trust in the current to pull you back in 
 I miss everyone at once 
 But most of all, I miss the ocean
