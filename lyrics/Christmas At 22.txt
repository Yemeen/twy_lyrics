Christmas At 22

-------------------------------

Winter break always seems so cold 
 I took my brother's keys and I drove 
 Turned the headlights on because it's already dark at 6 PM 
 I'll navigate familiar roads to the Christmas songs on the radio 
 I'll turn it off for "Let it Snow." I won't be snowed in 
 We're visiting some friends I haven't seen since August 
 To catch up on all the things we missed while we were in college 
 We'll find a house party when the bars close 
 And I'll drive all my drunken friends home 
 Proving once again that no one we've ever met 
 Has really changed that much since high school 
 Let's turn on the TV and wait for Christmas specials 
 We'll make some frozen pizza and watch your stolen cable 
 We'll thank whoever's in charge here that this year 
 Didn't treat me so bad 
 The day the ground starts to get wet 
 Everyone that I've ever met has an away message that says 
 "Faintest snow keep falling." New diners are packed out 
 With old friends. We're overwhelmed but unimpressed 
 I miss the days when I knew every single waitress 
 We'll find a house party when the bars close 
 We'll never spend the holidays alone 
 Proving once again that there's a reason my friends 
 Still tend to call this place home
