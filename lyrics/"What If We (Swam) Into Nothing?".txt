"What If We (Swam) Into Nothing?"

-------------------------------

We fell asleep last night watching TV 
 And the images worked their way into my dreams 
 We were watching turtles climbing the beach 
 The way she's looking at him is how you're looking at me 
 So if you miss me, or you get lonely 
 Then you can swim back (Just swim back) 
 You'll swim back to me 
 And I'll be watching the sea 
 For when you dance over the breakers 
 And waltz up the beach 
 Swim back to me 
 'Cause you've been gone since spring 
 You know that we can't breathe 
 Alone in the Gulf Stream 
 It's you with those sleepy eyes and heart-shaped shell 
 That keep me awake at night 
 So, meet me in the shallows off of Cozumel 
 We'll live our lives covered by moonlight 
 Maybe we were brought together by the ebb tide 
 It pulled the world beneath me and left you by my side 
 So swim back to me 
 And I'll be watching the sea 
 For when you dance over the breakers 
 And waltz up the beach 
 Swim back to me 
 'Cause you've been gone since spring 
 You know that we can't breathe 
 Alone in the Gulf Stream 
 What if we swam into nothing? 
 At least you'd still be beside me 
 So if we swam into nothing? 
 I'd still be smiling 
 So swim back to me 
 And I'll be watching the sea 
 For when you dance over the breakers 
 And waltz up the beach 
 Swim back to me 
 'Cause you've been gone since spring 
 You know that we can't breathe 
 Alone in the Gulf Stream 
 What if we swam into nothing?
