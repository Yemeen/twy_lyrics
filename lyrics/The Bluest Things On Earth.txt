The Bluest Things On Earth

-------------------------------

We sat quiet on the hill 
 Out just north of Wing's Field 
 Waiting on the runway lights 
 We were wrapped in winter coats 
 When I said I'd drive you home 
 You'd been pulling at your flask all night 
 I wrapped my arms around the moment like I'm clutching a memory 
 You alive in your madness, in love with the night 
 The glow of the furnace, the ambulance lights 
 The bluest things on Earth don't know shit about the blues 
 You used to be vibrant, you used to burn bright 
 Put out the light in your clouded eyes 
 Kept you inside through the summertime 
 Put up a fight, pressing flowers at night 
 In a book that you loved 
 The pieces they can't take of us 
 I found you shaking at the lake 
 A hospital bracelet still tight to your wrist 
 We talked to fill the empty space 
 Dance on the ice until it breaks 
 They flooded a town so this park could exist 
 You see us walking on the streets in your dreams 
 The pills that they fed you, your half-awake eyes 
 The bluest things on Earth don't know shit about the blues 
 You used to burn... 
 Put out the light in your clouded eyes 
 Kept you inside through the summertime 
 Put up a fight, pressing flowers at night 
 In a book that you loved 
 The pieces they can't take of us 
 Put out the light in your clouded eyes 
 Kept you inside through the summertime 
 Put up a fight, pressing flowers at night 
 In a book that you loved 
 There's pieces they can't take of us 
 There's pieces they can't take of us
