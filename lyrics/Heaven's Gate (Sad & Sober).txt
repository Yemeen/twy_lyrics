Heaven's Gate (Sad & Sober)

-------------------------------

I've been thinking a lot about 
 When the furnace goes 
 It's the absence of heat that hurts more than the cold 
 And I got caught in the irony of walking alone 
 Down an entire block that's just funeral homes and the ground below 
 Sad and sober Sunday afternoon 
 Sad and sober Sunday afternoon 
 You disappear in fragments and phases of the moon 
 Sad and sober Sunday afternoon 
 You disappear in fragments and phases of the moon 
 I watched parts of you dissolve 
 Turn to ash and then get carried up 
 I watched your memory fade 
 Shadows burned into the wall 
 And no, I felt my lungs turn into atom bombs 
 Choke on the Florida heat until the oxygen's gone 
 Sad and sober Sunday afternoon 
 You disappear in fragments and phases of the moon 
 Sad and sober Sunday afternoon 
 You disappear in fragments and phases of the moon 
 Or an empty room 
 Or the twelve-bar blues 
 Or a light in June 
 You were a bandit, and I was a car wreck 
 You were the decades on my feet 
 I was under purple blankets 
 You were a bandit, and I was a car wreck 
 You were the rifle on the wall 
 And it was always going to end 
 You were a bandit, and I was a car wreck 
 You were the false rain that falls 
 From a window AC unit 
 You were a bandit, and I was a car wreck 
 You were the rifle on the wall 
 And it was always going to end like this
