When Keeping It Real Goes Wrong

-------------------------------

I've got this job that equates swallowing shit where I puree food for dementia patients, and the commute is an hour each way 
 I'm so sick of taking the train 
 I guess that I'm a hypochondriac, 'cause I'm always sick, or at least I think I am 
 I wish the Tylenol would kick in 'cause I'm so sick of feeling the same 
 We know that everything is going to be okay 
 All we need is Kerouac and a glass of sweet tea, or burritos and New Found Glory 
 I'm just trying to get through the week 
 Hey, do you think that you could loan me ten bucks so that I could buy the new season of Scrubs? I'm short on cash this week and I'd pay you back on Thursday 
 I've got these friends that hate their fucking lives 
 I guess that's what inactivity does to the mind 
 So, I stay busy day and night 
 I don't have time to complain 
 Everything, everything, everything is going to be okay
