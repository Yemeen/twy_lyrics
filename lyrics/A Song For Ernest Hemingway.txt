A Song For Ernest Hemingway

-------------------------------

The sky goes from concrete to charcoal 
 I'm laying on my back on the roof 
 Gonna shoot these clouds full of holes 
 I need some fucking light to pour through 
 'Cause December's got me up against the ropes 
 And I don't know how to get loose 
 I can't get feeling back in my toes 
 I'm walking in circles with you 
 Like we're lost Canadian geese 
 I should be south of here already 
 I'll be your dead bird 
 You'll be my bloodhound 
 You're just doing what you're told 
 Pick my body off the ground 
 I'll be your dead bird 
 I'm staring at Hemingway's shotgun 
 And I picture him drinking alone 
 He's forgetting things that he wouldn't have before 
 His eyesight's starting to go 
 And I heard all about how his plane went down 
 After Christmas in the Congo 
 He read about his own death in the paper 
 I bet it was freeing to know 
 When you destroy anything worth chasing 
 There's nowhere left to go 
 I'll be your dead bird 
 You'll be my bloodhound 
 You're just doing what you're told 
 Pick my body off the ground 
 I'll be your dead bird 
 Hanging from your mouth 
 You're doing like you're told 
 You're gonna make your master proud 
 It's good to know 
 I didn't die for nothing 
 December's got me backed into a corner again 
 My ears are back, my teeth are showing 
 I'm combing through the wreckage trying just to find where I've been 
 I still get phantom pains, but from a safer distance 
 I'll be your dead bird 
 You'll be my bloodhound 
 You're just doing what you're told 
 Pick my body off the ground 
 I'll be your dead bird 
 Hanging from your mouth 
 You're doing like you're told 
 You're gonna make your master proud 
 It's good to know 
 I didn't die for nothing 
 December's got me backed into a corner again 
 My ears are back, my teeth are showing 
 (I didn't die for nothing) 
 I'm combing through the wreckage trying just to find where I've been 
 I still get phantom pains, I didn't die for nothing
