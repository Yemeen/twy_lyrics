Cardinals

-------------------------------

Cardinal crashed into my window, I think he might die 
 I'll plan him a funeral, I'll read his last rites 
 'Cause I know what he saw in that reflection of light 
 On the glass was a better life 
 Staring at a hole in your chest that's been dug there for decades 
 American, broken promises 
 Caught between the lies you've been fed and a war with your bloodstream 
 I should have been there when you needed a friend 
 I was off on my own again 
 Selfish and stupid 
 So if you call me back or let me in 
 (Call me back or let me in) 
 I swear I'll never let you down again 
 I know the devil you've been fighting with 
 (The devil you've been fighting) 
 I swear I'll never let you down again 
 I had that nightmare again, you're seven and helpless 
 Angry as hell and you balled up your fists 
 But I laughed at your swings and I beat you half-conscious 
 Know that I failed you, woke up in a sweat 
 I want those years back 
 So if you call me back or let me in 
 (Call me back or let me in) 
 I swear I'll never let you down again 
 I know the devil you've been fighting with 
 (The devil you've been fighting) 
 I swear I'll never let you down again 
 We're no saviours if we can't save our brothers 
 We're no saviours if we can't save our brothers 
 So if you call me back or let me in 
 (We're no saviours) (Call me back or let me in) 
 I swear I'll never let you down again 
 (If we can't save our brothers) 
 I know the devil you've been fighting with 
 (We're no saviours) (The devil you've been fighting) 
 I swear I'll never let you down again 
 (If we can't save our brothers) 
 So if you call me back or let me in 
 (We're no saviours) 
 I swear I'll never let you down again 
 (If we can't save our brothers) 
 I know the devil you've been fighting with 
 (We're no saviours) 
 I swear I'll never let you down again 
 (If we can't save our brothers) 
 Never let you down again
