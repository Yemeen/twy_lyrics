My Life As Rob Gordon

-------------------------------

Kelly says that at the end of each relationship 
 The boy starts quoting lyrics from that Movielife song 
 And my mom says there's songs with her name in them 
 Except that one about a crackhead in Janie's Got a Gun 
 Well Matt says, when I mentioned him in Bar Bands 
 Kids started asking questions 
 It got weird kinda quick 
 And I had a dream that 
 We named a kid we never had after Hannah Hold On 
 And I haven't listened since 
 Cause it tears me to pieces 
 Someone keeps putting on all of the sad songs 
 I keep singing along 
 The jukebox turns and I'm gone 
 I poked in all my quarters 
 Looking for the perfect swan song to walk out on 
 Stevie said that if I woke up feeling hopeless 
 That I should think about it different 
 That I had it all wrong 
 It's not the end if you call it a new beginning 
 Plus it's a chance to write some bitter fucking love songs 
 I heard Quentin belt the notes to some words that Alex wrote 
 About dying alone 
 And I felt sort of whole 
 It takes a fucked up head to think about dying alone 
 When you're in you're twenties 
 So I'm glad it's not just me 
 It takes a fucked up head to think about dying alone already 
 Someone keeps putting on all of the sad songs 
 I keep singing along 
 The jukebox turns and I'm gone 
 I poked in all my quarters 
 Looking for the perfect swan song to walk out on 
 Someone keeps putting on the sad songs 
 Someone keeps putting on the sad songs 
 Someone keeps putting on all of the sad songs 
 I keep singing along 
 The jukebox turns and I'm gone 
 I poked in all my quarters 
 Looking for the perfect swan song to walk out on
