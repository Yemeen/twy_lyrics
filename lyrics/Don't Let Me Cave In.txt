Don't Let Me Cave In

-------------------------------

You drove me all the way up here 
 Cause you could tell that I was a mess 
 I wasn't going to make it to dinner 
 And I shouldn't be calling again 
 You drove me all the way back 
 I circled the airport a hundred times 
 And tried to hide the fact that I was crying 
 I came in on the red eye 
 That's why I look like this 
 There comes a day when you rectify 
 Who you are with who you want to be with 
 And I can't make the two things co-exist 
 So don't let me cave in 
 You drove me all the way up here 
 Cause you could tell that I was a mess 
 I wasn't going to make it to dinner 
 And I shouldn't be calling again 
 You drove me all the way up here 
 And asked if we could stay in bed 
 You still got work early tomorrow 
 And I've got a plane to catch 
 You drove me all the way back 
 I spent last night getting Mexican 
 Outside a Logan Square basement show with Evan 
 Chicago looked desperate 
 But maybe that was me 
 I couldn't help thinking of watching 
 The Sears Tower collapse as a kid 
 I feel like I might do the same thing 
 So don't let it happen to me 
 No don't let it happen to me 
 (So let it happen to me) 
 You drove me all the way up here 
 Cause you could tell that I was a mess 
 I wasn't going to make it to dinner 
 And I shouldn't be calling again 
 You drove me all the way up here 
 And asked if we could stay in bed 
 You still got work early tomorrow 
 And I've got a plane to catch 
 You drove me all the way back 
 I tried to make a life in the Midwest 
 But the rust belt keeps breaking promises 
 I can't seem to find out where my footing is 
 So don't (don't don't don't) 
 Let (don't let me cave in) 
 So let me cave in 
 (Don't let me cave in)
