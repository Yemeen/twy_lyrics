I Just Want To Sell Out My Funeral

-------------------------------

Clear the apartment 
 I plan on collapsing and I 
 Could have sworn I heard a car door slam 
 I'm stuck at the corner 
 Of grinding teeth and stomach acid 
 All alone under the soft rain and a street lamp 
 Well I spent my life 
 Weighed down by a stone heart 
 Drowning in irony 
 And settling for anything 
 Somewhere down the line 
 All the wiring went faulty 
 I'm scared shitless of failure 
 And I'm staring out at where I wanna be 
 I just wanna sell out my funeral 
 I just wanna be enough for everyone 
 I just wanna sell out my funeral 
 Know I fought until the lights were gone 
 I'm walking through harbors and churchyards 
 I felt the snow crack under my feet 
 And I'll stay thankful for mild winters 
 For every shot I got at anything 
 I'll blame the way that I was brought up 
 Or the flaws that I was born with 
 Or the mistakes that I've made 
 They're all just fucking excuses 
 So bury me in the memories 
 Of my friends and family 
 I just need to know 
 That they were proud of me 
 I just wanna sell out my funeral 
 I just wanna be enough for everyone 
 I just wanna sell out my funeral 
 Know I fought until the lights were gone 
 And oh, they all wanna know 
 Where'd the American dream go? 
 Did you give up and go home? 
 Am I here alone? 
 And oh, as the credits roll 
 I'll watch as the screen glows 
 The moments when I choked 
 All the fears that I've outgrown 
 At least I'd hope so 
 I was just happy to be a contender 
 And I was just aching for anything 
 Well I used to have such steady hands 
 But now I can't keep 'em from shaking 
 Oh, I'm sorry, I 
 I'm sorry I don't laugh at the right times 
 Is this what it feels like 
 With my wings clipped? 
 I'm awkward and nervous 
 I'm awkward and nervous 
 I'm awkward and nervous 
 I'm awkward and nervous 
 But I was kind of hoping you'd stay 
 I was kind of hoping you'd stay 
 I was kind of hoping you'd stay 
 I need you to stay 
 Oh god, could you stay? 
 I need you to stay 
 Need you to stay 
 I need you 
 If I'm in an airport 
 And you're in a hospital bed 
 Well then, what kind of man does that make me? 
 If I'm in an airport 
 And you're in a hospital bed 
 Well then, what kind of man does that make me? 
 If I'm in an airport 
 If I'm in an airport 
 What kind of man does that make me? 
 What kind of man does that make me? 
 What kind of man does that make me? 
 I know how it feels to be 
 At war with a world that never loved me 
 When all we had were hand-me-downs 
 (I know how it feels to be) 
 (At war with a world that never loved me) 
 When all we had were hand-me-downs 
 (I know how it feels to be) 
 (At war with a world that never loved me) 
 All we had was good will 
 (I know how it feels to be) 
 (At war with a world that never loved me) 
 Two blackbirds on a highway sign 
 Are laughing at me here, with my wings clipped 
 I'm staring up at the sky 
 But the bombs keep fucking falling 
 There's no devil on my shoulder 
 He's got a rocking chair on my front porch 
 But I won't let him in 
 No, I won't let him in 
 'Cause I'm sick of seeing ghosts 
 And I know how it's all gonna end 
 There's no triumph waiting 
 There's no sunset to ride off in 
 We all wanna be great men 
 And there's nothing romantic about it 
 I just want to know that I did all I could 
 With what I was given
