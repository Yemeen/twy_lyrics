Buzz Aldrin

-------------------------------

Wouldn't it be cool if we were astronauts, zero gravity, two-one-blast off? 
 Take my hand it's time to leave this place. 
 Wouldn't if be cool if it were both of us, circumnavigate, map the stars out, see the world from here in outer space? 
 We're not trying to get away, just wanna see if the sun stays when we go to sleep. I'll hold your hand past 
 Mars, if 
 Orion looks at your wrong, I just may need to beat those pussy-ass stars.5-4-3-2-1 let's take off. 
 We're clear to go. 
 Everyday, we'll eat toothpaste and pretend we like the taste.
