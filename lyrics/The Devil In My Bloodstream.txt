The Devil In My Bloodstream

-------------------------------

We wiped out all the Buffalo 
 Around the turn of the last century 
 And so it's factories and sawgrass 
 Wheat fields and asphalt laid in front of me 
 The Midwest feels like a hollow place 
 That we filled with love and industry 
 And we're staring at the frozen ground in Goodwill suits 
 Silent as the pastor reads the eulogy 
 Well I, I wanted to see 
 Just a little bit of everything 
 Let me be 
 Two blackbirds on a highway sign 
 Are laughing at me at four in the morning 
 They played the war drum out of time 
 So I'm not sure where I've been marching 
 I wanna be strong 
 But it's not easy anymore 
 I'm hoping I'm wrong 
 It's sixteen hours straight to home 
 From the heart of North Missouri 
 And so I searched through my great-grandpop's memoirs 
 For the devil in my bloodstream 
 Depression grabbed his throat and 
 Choked the life out of him slowly 
 I got the same blood coursing through my veins 
 It'll come for me eventually 
 I bet I'd be a fucking coward 
 I bet I'd never have the guts for war 
 'Cause I can't spend another month away from here 
 These frantic rest stop phone calls don't get answered anymore 
 But I, I wanted to know 
 If I could please come home 
 So let me know 
 Two blackbirds on a highway sign 
 Are laughing at me at four in the morning 
 They played the war drum out of time 
 So I'm not sure where I've been marching 
 I wanna be strong 
 But it's not easy anymore 
 I'm hoping I'm wrong 
 I'm hoping I'm wrong 
 I know how it feels to be 
 At war with the world 
 That never loved me 
 (I'm hoping I'm wrong) 
 I know how it feels to be 
 At war with the world 
 That never loved me 
 Two blackbirds on a highway sign 
 Are laughing at me at four in the morning 
 They played the war drum out of time 
 So I'm not sure where I've been marching 
 I wanna be strong 
 I wanna be strong 
 But it's not easy anymore
