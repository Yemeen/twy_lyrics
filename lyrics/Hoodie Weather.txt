Hoodie Weather

-------------------------------

It smells like it should be snowing 
 And I've been frequenting a diner on Main Street 
 Where the waitresses are girls that graduated with me 
 Have problems with oxy and can't recall what I had to drink 
 No one knows where they're going 
 They just know they want out of here badly 
 They're like cigarettes dropped on a highway 
 They smash and scatter and burn out somewhere else without knowing 
 I've got my grandmother's veins in the back of my hands 
 And just a hint of a South Philly accent 
 I was born here and I'll probably die here 
 Let's go home 
 This town has got lies to tell 
 I'll wait around and hear you out 
 But I can't keep from digging up these bones forever 
 At least for now, I'll settle down 
 I'll try to find some solid ground 
 I lost my footing trying to get home last winter 
 The kids in the graduating class 
 Have got their eyes set west 
 And California on their lips 
 But I left some blood there that I'm never getting back 
 Rocky's in the Deep South 
 I don't think he's coming back now 
 It's sinister, but it's how life worked out 
 I've got my grandmother's veins in the back of my hands 
 And just a hint of a South Philly accent 
 I was born here and I'll probably die here 
 Let's go home 
 This town has got lies to tell 
 I'll wait around and hear you out 
 But I can't keep from digging up these bones forever 
 At least for now, I'll settle down 
 I'll try to find some solid ground 
 I lost my footing trying to get home last winter 
 Growing up means watching my heroes turn human in front of me 
 The songs we wrote at eighteen seem shortsighted and na√Øve 
 So when the weather breaks, I'll pull my hoodie up over my face 
 I won't run away, run away 
 As fucked as this place got, it made me me 
 This town has got lies to tell 
 I'll wait around and hear you out 
 But I can't keep from digging up these bones forever 
 At least for now, I'll settle down 
 I'll try to find some solid ground 
 I lost my footing trying to get home last winter 
 This town's got lies to tell
