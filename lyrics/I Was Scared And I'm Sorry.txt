I Was Scared And I'm Sorry

-------------------------------

I've been obviously on the verge of a mental breakdown this week 
 Stuck between your dirty sheets and back-lit memories 
 And I've been putting off things like getting my shit out of your apartment 
 I've been making up excuses about the things that you might need 
 And I've been trying to find out where everyone's been 
 But they're nowhere and I'm nothing 
 And I've been trying to stay as busy as I can 
 I finally broke on Christmas Eve 
 In an Outback Steakhouse bathroom while my family ordered for me 
 Haven't been losing sleep, no I pass out almost instantly 
 The bad dreams get worse every week 
 I think I'm losing a little of me 
 I'm getting better, but it's in small steps 
 I'm working on sleeping on the left 
 I just can't blame New York for this 
 And so I'm down again, but this time it's different 
 I'm mourning something that I miss 
 And that's better than being hopeless 
 I'm counting back on all my mistakes 
 From the back of the cop car where you told me you loved me 
 'Cause after that night, I got scared and I'm sorry 
 But hey, what can I say? 
 And I've been trying to find out where everyone's been 
 But they're nowhere 
 I'm still nothing 
 And I've been trying to find old friends 
 I'm getting better, but it's in small steps 
 I'm working on sleeping on the left 
 I just can't blame New York for this 
 And so I'm down again, but this time it's different 
 I'm mourning something that I miss 
 And that's better than being hopeless 
 It's getting weird to think 
 About the house on Manson Street 
 And how neither of us live there 
 It's probably empty 
 She watches Breakfast at Tiffany's, it calms her completely 
 I guess Sarah Marshall does the same for me 
 It's nothing when she's leaning on me and saying she's sorry 
 I'm obviously on the verge of a mental breakdown this week 
 I'm getting better, but it's in small steps 
 I'm working on sleeping on the left 
 I just can't blame New York for this 
 And so I'm down again, but this time it's different 
 I'm mourning something that I miss 
 And that's better than being hopeless
