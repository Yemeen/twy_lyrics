Don't Open The Fridge!

-------------------------------

Hey, home 
 It's nice to see you 
 I'm glad to see that the street got paved 
 Hey, Matt? 
 What have you been up to? 
 Is the shower working? I could use one today 
 We've got walls painted in chain grease 
 And shelves full of Bukowski poetry 
 That's enough for me and that's enough for me 
 These backyard nights are finally catching up to us 
 So, sing it louder, man. Let's turn it up 
 These bright pink walls and green rugs are just enough 
 We don't need more. You know we don't need much 
 Oh man 
 My Asian neighbors have been 
 Holding church services in their kitchen 
 Goddamn 
 What if they know of our plans to raise an army 
 Of homeless men in the basement? 
 We've got bike parts littering everything 
 And friends coming over to watch pro-wrestling 
 That's enough for me 
 These backyard nights are finally catching up to us 
 So, sing it louder, man. Let's turn it up 
 These bright pink walls and green rugs are just enough 
 We don't need more. You know we don't need... 
 This place is falling apart 
 The fridge here hasn't worked here since March (Hey!) 
 And so we're never paying rent unless you come and fix 
 The shape of how things are 
 This place is falling apart 
 (We know, one day, we'll move on!) 
 Goodbye, so long 
 (We know, one day, we'll move on!) 
 Goodbye, so long 
 These backyard nights are finally catching up to us 
 So, sing it louder, man. Let's turn it up 
 These bright pink walls and green rugs are just enough 
 We don't need more. You know we don't need much
