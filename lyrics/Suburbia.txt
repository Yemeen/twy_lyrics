Suburbia

-------------------------------

The bowling alley burnt down 
 They said it was a cigarette and I almost believed it 
 There were burns in the carpet 
 But everyone knows that it was for the insurance 
 This is where you pick up the bus 
 The most famous person to come out of here was 
 The guy that played Leatherface in all those chainsaw massacres 
 Every business on Main Street collapsed except Morgan's mom's place 
 And the whole town feels dead 
 The whole town feels dead 
 And the whole town, the whole town feels dead 
 I can't blame it
