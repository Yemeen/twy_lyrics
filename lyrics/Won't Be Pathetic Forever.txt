Won't Be Pathetic Forever

-------------------------------

Well I've been waking up at 12 PM in my boxers in this empty bed 
 Eating Sour Patch Watermelons the boys murked the day before 
 Watching bad reruns of MADtv, that shit's not even close to funny 
 But I don't work today 'til three and the remote is on the floor, so 
 When are you coming over? 
 Please just say right now 
 We won't sleep our lives away 
 And today, and today, and today we'll make waves 
 In this lake of shit we've made 
 I refuse to sink 
 We can't live our lives this way 
 Not today, or today, or today 
 If this sea of metaphoric bullshit stays 
 I won't sink 
 The party starts at 9 P.M. in which ever house is close and vacant 
 We'll call the ten friends we've got left to pretend we've got a life 
 And the boys are slaying shitty brews, but I've been slaying orange juice 
 You know we don't got shit to do, I guess we'll stay the night, fuck 
 It's too cold out to ride my bike today 
 It's been raining since we got home last week 
 We won't sleep our lives away 
 And today, and today, and today we'll make waves 
 In this lake of shit we've made 
 I refuse to sink 
 We can't live our lives this way 
 Not today, or today, or today 
 If this sea of metaphoric bullshit stays 
 I won't sink 
 And some nights 
 (I fucking love this town) 
 (I fucking love this town) 
 But most nights 
 (I fucking hate this town) 
 (I fucking hate this) 
 And some nights 
 (I fucking love this town) 
 (I fucking love this town) 
 But most nights 
 (I fucking hate this town) 
 But most nights 
 (I fucking hate this) 
 Lately, I've been thinking about being a doctor or a teacher (I refuse to sink) 
 Lately, I've been thinking about being somebody at all (I refuse to sink) 
 Lately, I've been thinking about being a doctor or a teacher 
 Just someone who changes something (I need to be) 
 Someone who changes something (I gotta be) 
 Someone who changes something 
 Anything
