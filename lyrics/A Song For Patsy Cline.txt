A Song For Patsy Cline

-------------------------------

My airbag light's been on for weeks 
 And I keep having dreams 
 Where I go through the windshield but I don't fix it 
 Patsy Cline came and sang to me 
 She told everybody 
 How she knew she would die soon before she did 
 I hear you cry on Faded Love 
 [1] 
 The air in August here's heavy with salt and smoke and stings my lungs 
 My airbag light's been on for weeks 
 And I can feel it mock me 
 It's bittersweet like laughter through crooked teeth 
 I wanna move so far from everything 
 That they can hear my heart beat 
 And then break as I lay dying in the street 
 They'll think the ice cracked at the lake 
 They'll think a tire blew out and a car crashed on the interstate 
 It's hard to watch you walk away 
 These aren't the vultures that were circling just yesterday 
 It's hard to watch you walk away (It's hard to watch you walk away) 
 They're picking at bones, at what's left of your misery 
 So when my vocal chords rip 
 So when my knees give in 
 So when I bury all of this 
 Who's gonna give a shit 
 If I'm breathing? 
 It's hard to watch you walk away 
 These aren't the vultures that were circling just yesterday 
 It's hard to watch you walk away (It's hard to watch you walk away) 
 They're picking at bones, at what's left of your misery 
 (Whoa, whoa) My airbag light's been on for weeks 
 (Whoa, whoa) My airbag light's been on for weeks
