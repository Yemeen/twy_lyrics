When The Blue Finally Came

-------------------------------

Watch the sun burn out and dig itself a grave 
 In the ocean south of Sydney off the interstate 
 And I hold out my hand trying not to shake 
 Watched you jump off of a cliff 
 And start to levitate 
 And yeah I'm afraid 
 But I'll follow you anyway 
 When the blue finally came 
 It swallowed up everything 
 In the sea of trees 
 I thought that I'd hear ghosts in the waves 
 When the wind blew through 
 I heard joy return to a cold and lonesome place 
 I made out your voice, but I can't ask you to stay 
 Watched you walk into the woods 
 And start to levitate 
 And yeah I'm afraid 
 But I'll follow you anyway 
 When the blue finally came 
 It swallowed up everything
