No Closer To Heaven

-------------------------------

I'm digging up the bones 
 Of the failures I've buried 
 I'm pulling down my white flags 
 In varying stages of sun-bleached and grey 
 Gonna sew 'em all together 
 Gonna fashion the bones into a frame 
 Tie the flags on with string 
 Stretched across until they're wings 
 I'm no closer to heaven 
 I clipped a bird 
 With my car on the freeway 
 He won't see a burial 
 And all week long, I kept thinking of death 
 How me and Hemingway share forehead scars 
 I won't meet the same fate that he did 
 In a world that I can't fix 
 With a hammer in my grip 
 I'm no closer to heaven 
 It feels like the day before something important 
 It feels like the first snow of the season that sticks 
 It's how I'll always feel like a failure 
 In the back of my head 
 No matter where I've been 
 The future feels bright 
 Like the glow of a city 
 Out across the Great Plains 
 Where the closer I get, the further I feel away 
 I could stay here in the darkness 
 Feels like I'm wandering in circles for days 
 I may never reach the gates 
 I'll keep walking anyway 
 No closer to heaven
