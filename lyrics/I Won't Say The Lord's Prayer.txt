I Won't Say The Lord's Prayer

-------------------------------

It's a series of bars, thrift stores and churches 
 Lining the streets 
 While women with gold crosses push kids 
 Into half-formed beliefs 
 And if Lord was righteous 
 I think I'd rather not be 
 We lean on fences built from 
 Out-dated morality 
 It's a gang mentality 
 It's a dangerous thing 
 They don't ask you to think 
 Just to repeat after me 
 And assume you're too careless 
 To look at it critically 
 You'll stop progress if it contradicts what 
 You're told to believe 
 And I refuse to spend life on my knees 
 These billboards that flaunt 
 These scare tactics 
 Make me think you're only good if 
 You're afraid of being punished 
 Every single Sunday 
 Church bells wake me up 
 But it's never enough 
 To pull me out of bed 
 The church on Main Street 
 Has got its doors painted red, and I guess 
 It's so the Angel of Death passes over it 
 On its way to get gas 
 The church on Broad Street 
 Has got a neon sign that says 'Jesus Save Me' 
 And I guess, it's so God can see from 
 Where he is, in these cheap seats 
 And I refuse to spend life on my knees 
 And I won't let somebody else 
 (Somebody else, somebody else, somebody else) 
 Somebody else make my decisions for me 
 (Make them for me) 
 If we're all just Christians or Lions 
 I think I'd rather be 
 On the side with sharper teeth 
 I don't need saving
