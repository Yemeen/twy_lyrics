Racing Trains

-------------------------------

There's always someone on the train with me that wants to talk about everything when I just want to fall asleep. The train is late for the third time this week and everyday its raining around 9:15. I've worn these rails thin and ran for the train again. It's always late to the station. Rush hour came and went, three to a seat and we're filled up with awkward conversation.
