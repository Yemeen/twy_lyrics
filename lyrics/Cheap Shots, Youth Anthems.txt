Cheap Shots, Youth Anthems

-------------------------------

I remember ten years ago, hard to stay out of trouble when there's no place to go 
 Killing out of line 
 We threw all caution to the wind 
 It was hard enough just to be a kid, let alone deal with the problems I was given 
 I didn't care what youth had to offer 
 It seemed it was "in" 
 Call us up and play a show, say "it's over 21" and we'll say, "hell no!" 'cause it's all ages! I see it all around me everyday 
 Kids are bored and surrounded by negativity 
 Killing time out line 'cause they're kept away 
 Influences come from every side and I don't want to be a part of troubling your lives 
 So, if they don't let you in, then we're not gonna play 
 Just because you're not 21, that's not supposed to mean you can't have any fun 
 So, come out and raise your fists high, stage dive, and forget about what they say 
 Dance the night away
