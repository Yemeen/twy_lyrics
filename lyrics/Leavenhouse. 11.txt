Leavenhouse. 11

-------------------------------

I think it was 1999 
 That seems about right 
 Right where Maple and 8th Street collide 
 I think it was at that place and time 
 We came to decide the next ten years of our lives 
 I feel there were reasons why 
 'Cause I think we felt lost sometimes 
 In overcrowded high schools 
 We're just getting by 
 So Brian sings "I am my own mountain." 
 I feel like I'm waiting for my time, my time 
 Hey, we're complicated 
 There's tables full of records and homemade zines and 
 Hey, we're underrated 
 And though we weren't changing the world, it was the world to me 
 In about six years, we'd evolved 
 And centered it all 
 Right on second where Mitchell left off 
 It was a cold October fall 
 VFW hall 
 Singing songs while my friends sang along 
 Some days the cops get called 
 But no, we won't knock this off 
 We're diving off of pool tables, we're piling on 
 And when we're cleaning up, VFW Mike gets drunk 
 He tells us about girls he got in Vietnam 
 Best dude 
 Hey, we're complicated 
 There's tables full of records and homemade zines and 
 Hey, we're underrated 
 And though we weren't changing the world, it was the world to me 
 This town sounds dead when I come through, lately 
 I can't forget the ways he shaped me
