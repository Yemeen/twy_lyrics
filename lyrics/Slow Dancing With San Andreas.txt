Slow Dancing With San Andreas

-------------------------------

Well, the heat coming off of the highway 
 Makes the mountains out in the distance 
 Look like they're shuddering 
 Look like they lost themselves in a moment 
 They hate remembering 
 I know the feeling 
 I want you to know 
 (I want you to know) 
 I don't feel so alone 
 (I don't feel so alone) 
 I'm slow dancing with San Andreas 
 Scared to death I won't walk these streets again 
 If we fail, are we collateral damage? 
 Did any of this make a difference? 
 These snow drifts haunt the Dakotas 
 Like they're ghosts crawling on the freeway 
 Looking for a resting place 
 Looking for roadside memorials, crosses and roses 
 A makeshift grave 
 A place they could fade away 
 I want you to know 
 (I want you to know) 
 I don't feel so alone, no no no no 
 (I don't feel so alone) 
 I'm slow dancing with San Andreas 
 Scared to death I won't walk these streets again 
 If we fail, are we collateral damage? 
 Did any of this make a difference? 
 I'm drowning in shallow water 
 I'm singing through the lump in my throat again 
 If I'm given a voice but I don't say a thing 
 Is that blood on my hands? 
 My grandfather drove a city bus 
 So maybe all this wandering in circles 
 Comes from somewhere in my blood 
 My grandfather drove a city bus 
 So maybe all this restlessness, this discontent 
 This constant search for progress is in my blood 
 I'm slow dancing with San Andreas 
 Scared to death I won't walk these streets again 
 If we fail, are we collateral damage? 
 Did any of this make a difference? 
 I'm drowning in shallow water 
 I'm singing through the lump in my throat again 
 If I'm given a voice but I don't say a thing 
 Is that blood on my hands?
