I Fell In Love With A Ninja Master

-------------------------------

With a smoke bomb you're gone and I'm alone 
 I'm waiting for you to get home, tired of sitting here with the swords you own 
 I'm starting to worry about you 
 Your skin is always black and blue 
 You can't defend this city all alone, its true 
 I'm forced away (its nunchucks to the face) 
 I'm missing your warm but deadly embrace 
 I can't make out the shape of your face 
 You've masked it with all your honor and grace 
 Let's not say you broke my heart 
 You pierced it with a throwing star 
 It was an accident 
 I know your aim is off 
 Jump kicks are getting hard to miss 
 All I wanted was a kiss 
 It's getting really hard to live like this 
 You've been throwing stars at my heart and now we've come this far 
 I should have seen it from the start 
 I see that it's finally time to part 
 You fucked me up with your poison dart 
 I shoulda seen it from the fucking start
