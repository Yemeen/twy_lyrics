We Won't Bury You

-------------------------------

I had to let you know 
 That everyone back home 
 Passed on the word 
 Of where you went wrong 
 So, from the deep south 
 Outside a Waffle House 
 I called to wish you well 
 And got your voice mail 
 So let me know 
 If there's something we can do 
 'Cause we won't bury you 
 So I heard the news 
 And your Get Up Kids tattoos 
 Mean somethin' new 
 But the words still ring true 
 'Cause we'll all forgive you 
 But you can't forget 
 That you know better than this 
 Don't end up like he did 
 And I guess 
 It's none of my business 
 But I hope you're well, old friends
