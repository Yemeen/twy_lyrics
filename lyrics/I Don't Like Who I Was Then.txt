I Don't Like Who I Was Then

-------------------------------

Tossed around like sea glass and you rounded out my edges 
 I'll feel better when the headaches go away 
 I got a scar across my forehead turning purple in the cold 
 From a night at Shore Memorial, I was sixteen and afraid 
 Turned away, like I'm working baby face 
 Out of mid-south in the 80s 
 I kept a blade hidden in my wrist tape 
 I think I'm growing into someone you could trust 
 I want to shoulder the weight till my back breaks 
 I want to run till my lungs give up 
 If I could manage not to fuck this up 
 If I could manage not to fuck this up 
 I think enough is enough 
 Hidden in the tall grass in the naked light of day 
 I put my past-self in the ground, I've been dancing on the grave 
 I'm not the person that I was then, I'm tearing him away 
 I was bitter, I was careless, I was nineteen and afraid 
 But you deserved more from me 
 I don't know why I would say those things 
 But you deserved more from me and I'm trying every day 
 I think I'm growing into someone you could trust 
 I want to shoulder the weight till my back breaks 
 I want to run till my lungs give up 
 If I could manage not to fuck this up 
 If I could manage not to fuck this up 
 I think enough is enough 
 You left me walking in circles 
 You were a shot in the dark 
 You were the baby teeth I buried 
 You were the sounds of distant cars 
 You left me walking in circles 
 You were a shot in the dark 
 You were the banner that says "no one" 
 That I tattooed across my heart 
 You left me walking in circles 
 You were a shot in the dark 
 You're scattered like ashes across every song that I write 
 You're where the light pollution starts 
 I think I'm growing into someone you could trust 
 I want to shoulder the weight till my back breaks 
 I want to run till my lungs give up 
 If I could manage not to fuck this up 
 If I could manage not to fuck this up 
 Enough is enough
