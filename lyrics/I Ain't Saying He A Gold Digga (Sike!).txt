I Ain't Saying He A Gold Digga (Sike!)

-------------------------------

My heart is broken now cause all I had is gone 
 My cheeks are moist 
 But you best brace yourself revenge is coming on 
 I've got no choice 
 And me I had my pot of gold 
 And you left me here broken and cold 
 When you're cornered now all out of friends 
 And you're all but dead, you're all but dead 
 And now it's time for your life to end 
 And you're all but dead, you're all but dead 
 Dear mister leprechaun you've crossed a line in the sand 
 You met your match 
 But now the time has come to taste the back of my hand 
 You should be dead 
 And me I had my pot of gold 
 And you left me here broken and cold 
 When you're cornered now all out of friends 
 And you're all but dead, you're all but dead 
 And now it's time for your life to end 
 And you're all but dead, you're all but dead 
 The end of the line the end of the rainbow 
 When you're cornered now all out of friends 
 And you're all but dead, you're all but dead 
 And now it's time for your life to end you're dead 
 When you're cornered now all out of friends 
 And you're all but dead, you're all but dead 
 And now it's time for your life to end
