Local Man Ruins Everything

-------------------------------

The fountain was off 
 This is the first time I've been 
 Back to the city in months 
 I'm trying to hold it together 
 But irony's found cracks in the foundation 
 And you know 
 I try so hard to be some great white hope 
 But I can't shake the feeling that tonight 
 I'm gonna end up shaking in bed alone 
 I'm not a self-help book 
 I'm just a fucked up kid 
 (I had to take my own advice and I did) 
 Now I'm waiting for it to sink in 
 Expect me standing tall, back against the wall 
 'Cause what I learned was 
 It's not about forcing happiness 
 It's about not letting sadness win 
 I don't have roses in the closet 
 But I've got pictures in a drawer 
 It's everything left in me 
 Not to stare at 'em any more 
 I walked upstairs and shaved my beard 
 I felt like I was holding sadness here 
 (I was holding sadness here) 
 I'm not a self-help book 
 I'm just a fucked up kid 
 (I had to take my own advice and I did) 
 Now I'm waiting for it to sink in 
 Expect me standing tall, back against the wall 
 'Cause what I learned was 
 It's not about forcing happiness 
 It's about not letting sadness win 
 I don't have roses in the closet 
 But I've got pictures in a drawer 
 It's everything left in me 
 Not to stare at 'em any more 
 I'm not a self-help book 
 I'm just a fucked up kid 
 (I had to take my own advice and I did) 
 I'm not a self-help book 
 I'm just a fucked up kid 
 I'm not a self-help book 
 I'm just a fucked up kid 
 (I had to take my own advice and I did) 
 I'm not a self-help book 
 I'm just a fucked up kid
