We Were Giants

-------------------------------

We're dead soon if I don't save you 
 An asteroid's coming to wipe out the species and, who's with me? We'll die trying, do anything to save our families 
 My wife says, "Please, don't go 
 We need you at home 
 You know how the kids get." So, Gentlemen, say goodbye to your families first 
 We've got one last shot before a meteor crushes the earth 
 If we arrive at the ice age first we sing, "tell my mother I'm never coming home." Circumvent the problem with charts and graphs on the nature of impact 
 Life and death are just words when our hearts are set on being victorious 
 Let's move men, we've got a plan and miles to go before the sun sets 
 We stand so tall 
 We live above this world 
 We are so fucking invincible 
 So line up and prepare your tails, men 
 On my word, swing in unison because here it is 
 We're oh so easily amused by everything we though we know but oh, my God it's too late 
 We're blow away 
 We were giants up until today
