My Geraldine Lies Over The Delaware

-------------------------------

I can't take a breath because the air stinks and I can't take a step without listening to your fucking accent while you're saying words with 'R's misplaced 
 So, fuck Route 9 
 I can pump my own gas, now you're crossing the line 
 Fuck route 9 
 You're water tastes like ass, just stay on your side 
 We'll leave tonight if you're okay to drive 
 We'll leave this place behind 
 Thank God we don't live here all the time
