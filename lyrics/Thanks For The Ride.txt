Thanks For The Ride

-------------------------------

I washed chain grease and blood off of my hands in the ocean 
 I let the salt water rinse the dirt away 
 I stood calm in a room I hadn't been in in a decade 
 I felt dizzy, used to stand here everyday 
 Wait out the storm in a harbor town 
 Pretend I'll see you in fall 
 Wait out the storm in a harbor town, whoa 
 Hey Hannah, don't go 
 We could have given you such a beautiful home 
 I won't call, know you're waiting right outside 
 Thanks for the ride 
 I watched lines of container ships drift in just off of Long Beach 
 I thought long about where you would be today 
 We'd lose touch after college came and went, I'd hear you got married 
 To some boy from California; have a baby on the way 
 Wait out the storm in a harbor town 
 Pretend I'll see you in fall 
 Wait out the storm in a harbor town, whoa 
 Hey Hannah, don't go 
 We could have given you such a beautiful home 
 I won't call, know you're waiting right outside 
 Thanks for the ride 
 Hey Hannah, don't go 
 We could have given you such a beautiful home 
 I won't call, know you're waiting right outside 
 I'm letting balloons drift off - tiny gifts to a lonely god 
 Darlin', please wake up 
 I'm letting balloons drift off - tiny gifts to a lonely god 
 If you see her, tell her I'm not giving up 
 (See her, tell her I'm not giving up) 
 Hey Hannah, don't go 
 We could have given you such a beautiful home 
 I won't call, know you're waiting right outside 
 Hey Hannah, don't go 
 We could have given you such a beautiful home 
 I won't call, know you're waiting right outside 
 Thanks for the ride 
 Hey Hannah, don't go 
 We could have given you such a beautiful home 
 I won't call, know you're waiting right outside 
 Thanks for the ride
