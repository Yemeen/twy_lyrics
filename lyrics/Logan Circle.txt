Logan Circle

-------------------------------

They turned on the fountain today 
 As I rode down 19th to Logan Circle 
 I felt somethin' in me change 
 And I was thinking about 
 How we all feel it's been down 
 The world's not that bad of a place 
 We just can't blame the seasons 
 The Blue Man Group won't cure depression 
 But Arrested Development might, if we let it 
 And you should come by at eleven 
 We're 533 on Manson, I haven't thought 
 That much about high school in ages, and 
 I can't pretend 
 So I'm afraid that we're wasting away 
 We're all sleeping in circles or talkin' shit in diners 
 And I've been better but I'm feeling okay 
 I'm not even sad anymore 
 I'm just so tired most nights 
 Well I've been drowning my sorrows in Lucky Charms and soy milk 
 For the record, I'm not vegan, I just prefer the taste 
 We're getting pretzels with fireworks at midnight 
 And I don't need maps or sidewalk cracks this way 
 We wrote the upsides in my basement 
 And pissed off all the neighbors 
 Jess and I barely slept when they had sex 
 This street has been seen much worse 
 Than some fucking pop-punk band, and 
 I used to hate it, but I miss it since I left 
 So I'm afraid that we're wasting away 
 We're all sleeping in circles or talkin' shit in diners 
 And I've been better but I'm feeling okay 
 I'm not even sad anymore 
 I'm just so tired most nights 
 They turned on the fountain today at Logan Circle 
 They turned on the fountain today 
 They turned on the fountain today at Logan Circle 
 I felt somethin' in me 
 See, I'm afraid that we're wasting away, I'm afraid 
 So I'm afraid that we're wasting away 
 We're all sleeping in circles or talkin' shit in diners 
 And I've been better but I'm feeling okay 
 I'm not even sad anymore
