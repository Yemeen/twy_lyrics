You In January

-------------------------------

Goddamn, you look holy 
 Hit from behind with light 
 You're a painting of a saint 
 And I'm nervous stumbling over my lines 
 When I tell you I love you 
 And we stare at Catalina 
 A city lost to the sea 
 Carried out by the tide 
 You were the one thing I got right 
 Goddamn, you look holy 
 Bathed in the January light 
 On the floor of our new bedroom 
 On the carpet with the window opened wide 
 When you tell me you love me 
 I can actually see it 
 Your breath frozen in the air 
 Newborn droplets of ice 
 You were the one thing I got right 
 I'm measuring heartbeats in miles away 
 You held me together, I used to burst and decay 
 We got off the airplane, a couple of runaways 
 I was hoping you'd stay 
 Could you stay? 
 You were the obvious one 
 From a taxicab in Chelsea, out past Salvation Mountain 
 You were the obvious one 
 From a walk along the highline, out to Wicker Park in August 
 You were the obvious one 
 From your upper-east side dorm room, to the southwest Marin Headlands 
 With you smiling in the sand 
 Goddamn, I hate leaving 
 Another early flight 
 I ran the dishwasher this morning 
 I wanted there to be clean plates for you tonight 
 I've grown used to your perfume 
 It hangs in the morning light 
 Wake me up before you leave for work 
 Kiss me goodbye 
 You were the one thing I got right 
 I'm measuring heartbeats in miles away 
 You held me together, I used to burst and decay 
 We got off the airplane, a couple of runaways 
 I was hoping you'd stay 
 Could you stay? 
 I'm measuring heartbeats in miles away 
 You held me together, I used to burst and decay 
 We got off the airplane, a couple of runaways 
 I'm glad that you stayed
