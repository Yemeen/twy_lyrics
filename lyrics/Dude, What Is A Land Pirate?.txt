Dude, What Is A Land Pirate?

-------------------------------

Sweetheart, you don't understand 
 Pirates weren't made to dance 
 We just weren't made for it 
 We slit throats, we don't cut rugs, but if it means that much, I guess that I could take a chance 
 We'll both go, we'll both go 
 I won't ruin your night 
 You know how I get into knife-fights (What if my leg breaks while we dance?) 
 Then, we'll both go down 
 So I paint my peg leg for the prom 
 I've been practicing my dance moves all year long 
 So you'd better keep a look out, in case I go for second (third) base with my hook out 
 I went out and got a tux and a limo for the both of us 
 I pulled up trying to impress 
 Despite how hard I tried, you cried and ruined our night, just cause my bird shit on your dress 
 We won't fucking go down 
 (We spike punch with barrels of rum 
 We loot and steal to seal the deal.) Say what you will about me and how I do things, but don't you open your mouth about Polly 
 I guess we made a scene cause in come the police, waving guns and asking me to leave 
 We won't even try to say goodnight, 'cause we know that you won't apologize 
 We won't even try to say goodnight, 'cause we know that you still think you're right and we mean the things we say 
 We say just what we mean
