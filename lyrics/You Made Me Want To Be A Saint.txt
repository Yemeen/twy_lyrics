You Made Me Want To Be A Saint

-------------------------------

It was how Dave said "us" 
 Like the last three years had never happened 
 It was how George walked down and threw dirt onto the casket 
 It was how I know you would want this to be a fast one 
 And not some clich√© ballad 
 I'm slowing down in the August air 
 A heavy heart and shaking hands carried you up here 
 I buried half of a decade there 
 It was the better part 
 You'd catch the reference if only you could hear 
 Because I can still hear you in the bass drum beat after "I'll Catch You" 
 I'm left wondering if you meant anything when you typed out 
 "You never got me down, Ray. I never went down" 
 You know the fucked up part is 
 I kind of always knew we'd have to write a song about this 
 You know the fucked up part is 
 I had my fingers crossed that it wouldn't be for you, kid 
 You know the fucked up part is 
 It's been months, and I still have nightmares 
 You know the fucked up part is 
 I'm never going back there 
 You know the fucked up part is 
 The fuckedup part isthefuck edup partisth efuckedu ppartisfuckfuckfuck.
