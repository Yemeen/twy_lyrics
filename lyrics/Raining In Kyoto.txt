Raining In Kyoto

-------------------------------

Raining in Kyoto 
 It's flooding the streets 
 I'm nursing a coffee from a vending machine 
 I saw the god of rice, a fox with a key 
 I woke up blind with a headache 
 Grinding my teeth 
 Confused and alone and taking pills to sleep 
 They soften your absence but they don't let me dream 
 Raining in Kyoto 
 My breath turns into steam 
 I'll buy you a candle, not even sure what it means 
 But I cursed at the matches 
 And drown in my grief 
 An older man stood close by, and smiled at me 
 I rung the bell like he did 
 And I told you I'm sorry 
 A makeshift funeral, I tried setting you free 
 You're half asleep 
 And I bought you a radio to drown out the machines 
 Hospital light, you asked about the weather, wished that they'd let you outside 
 Raining in Kyoto 
 I'm starting to shake 
 They'll hold your service tomorrow 
 I'm an ocean away 
 Reached into my pocket, found a small paper crane 
 It's been over a year now 
 April fades into May 
 I've barely stopped moving, I've been so fucking afraid 
 Too much of a coward to even visit your grave 
 You're half awake 
 And I bought you a radio to play the blues away 
 With my hand to hold, you asked about the weather, wish they'd let you die at home 
 You're half awake 
 And I bought you a radio to play the blues away 
 Hospital light, you asked about the weather wished that they'd let you outside 
 Goodnight 
 Goodnight 
 Goodbye
