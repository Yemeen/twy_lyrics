I Wanted So Badly To Be Brave

-------------------------------

I cut open my palm and held it out to you 
 You did the same with your old army surplus blade 
 My blood's never as warm as I expect it 
 You grabbed my hand adorned in wildflower warpaint 
 You made yellows out of marigolds 
 You made purple out of camellias 
 We charged headfirst into the woods with bows and arrows drawn 
 Crudely fashioned - sticks and rubber bands and spray paint 
 We swore ourselves protectors from all the evil in the world 
 You weren't born my brother, but you're gonna die that way 
 You ran alone (You ran alone) 
 In the falling snow, barefoot down White's Road 
 I watched your bruises grow (Your bruises grow) 
 Strangely beautiful, purple and yellow 
 You said, "Don't 
 Don't take me home, don't take me home, don't take me home" 
 Your father came in angry like a thunderstorm 
 Tossed you room from room and I watched color draining from your face 
 Fault lines started forming underneath all of your floorboards 
 We sat terrified, waiting on an earthquake 
 I watched you put on a brave face 
 I wanted so badly to be brave 
 But you ran alone (You ran alone) 
 In the falling snow, barefoot down White's Road 
 I watched your bruises grow (Your bruises grow) 
 Strangely beautiful, purple and yellow 
 You said, "Don't 
 Don't take me home, don't take me home, don't take me home" 
 They kicked you out to teach you what a man is 
 But I don't think I'll ever know what that means 
 They'll put a gun into your hand and call you weak until you're violent 
 Don't believe it, they're hateful 'cause they're empty 
 We got a chance to break the cycle 
 We could be the heroes that we always said we'd be 
 But don't take me home, don't take me home, don't take me 
 Don't take me home, don't take me home, don't take me home, home 
 Don't take me home, don't take me home, don't take me home, home 
 Don't take me home, don't take me home, don't take me
