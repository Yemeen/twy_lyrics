Raining in Kyoto
It's flooding the streets
I'm nursing a coffee from a vending machine
I saw the god of rice, a fox with a key
I woke up blind with a headache
Grinding my teeth
Confused and alone and taking pills to sleep
They soften your absence but they don't let me dream
Raining in Kyoto
My breath turns into steam
I'll buy you a candle, not even sure what it means
But I cursed at the matches
And drown in my grief
An older man stood close by, and smiled at me
I rung the bell like he did
And I told you I'm sorry
A makeshift funeral, I tried setting you free
You're half asleep
And I bought you a radio to drown out the machines
Hospital light, you asked about the weather, wished that they'd let you outside
Raining in Kyoto
I'm starting to shake
They'll hold your service tomorrow
I'm an ocean away
Reached into my pocket, found a small paper crane
It's been over a year now
April fades into May
I've barely stopped moving, I've been so fucking afraid
Too much of a coward to even visit your grave
You're half awake
And I bought you a radio to play the blues away
With my hand to hold, you asked about the weather, wish they'd let you die at home
You're half awake
And I bought you a radio to play the blues away
Hospital light, you asked about the weather wished that they'd let you outside
Goodnight
Goodnight
Goodbye


I saw you hiding in the ivy
I know you’re too afraid to call
They’re getting ready for the winter here
They’ve gathered pyramids of salt
You saw them having trouble breathing
I know you think that it’s your fault
I saw you hiding in the ivy
Keeping quiet through the fall
There’s a bird inside your rib cage
He screams so I never forget
I wanna break open your sternum
I wanna rip him from his nest
And sow you back up like a garden
Growing flowers from your chest
There’s a bird inside your rib cage
I keep trying to forget
I drew a line in the sand with these worthless fucking hands
I drew a line in the sand, you washed it away again
I saw you hiding in the ivy
Watched the night start to decay
And you wonder in the morning who’s gonna drag
The sun out of the lake
You move gently off the sore spots
I can see that you're in pain
Everything left in the light here long enough
Is someday gonna fade
I drew a line in the sand with these worthless fucking hands
I drew a line in the sand, you washed it away again
I drew a line in the sand with these goddamn worthless hands
I drew a line in the sand, you washed it away again
We’re so vacant
These bodies
Collapsing
So gracefully
And I love you
And I’m sorry
And I understand if you blame me
And I’m helpless
And you’re drowning
And I’m beating at the water here so desperately
So desperately
I drew a line in the sand with these worthless fucking hands
I drew a line in the sand,you washed it away again
I drew a line in the sand with these goddamn worthless hands
I drew a line in the sand, you washed it away again
Don't wash me away again


I'm a raw nerve in the sunlight
After two weeks in the dark
If you've gotta tell me you're not using
It's probably 'cause you are
I saw you there
Just a block off the sea, you're a rowhome
On an empty street where the others have been torn down
And you're the last one standing
It must get lonely
It must get lonely
When the gray starts to swallow gray
Where the sky meets the Irish sea
Like a suit that's been to too many funerals
And starts fraying at the seams
I saw a bag of clementines split right open on an English street
And the contrast made me feel so goddamn dizzy
I saw you there
A block off the sea, you're a rowhome
On an empty street
The others have been torn down
You're the last one standing
It must get obvious enough that I'm not ever gonna change
It must get obvious enough, I'm the one who stays
But it must get lonely
It must get lonely
But it must get lonely
But it must get lonely
I'm a specter in the dim light on the flowers by the grave
In the Montmartre in Paris
Where the crows seem to know my name
And they left footprints in the snow
Along the fence on Palmer Street
Cigarette butts on the headstones
That you left for me
I saw you there
Just a block off the sea, you're a rowhome
On an empty street where the others have been torn down
And you're the last one standing
It must get obvious enough that I'm not ever gonna change
It must get obvious enough that I'm the one who stays
It must get obvious enough that I'm not ever gonna change
It must get obvious enough, that you're the one who stays
But it must get lonely


The moon is hanging low, over the central station
I watch the buses leave in silence, bound for foreign distant places
The Andes hold me close
A mothers only son
I feel weightless in the valley, like I'm everywhere at once
I'm laying low
A stray dog in the street
You took me home
We’re sister cities
I'm laying low
A stray dog in the street
You took me home
We came here abandoned
An old brick faced apartment
Rusted swing set in the courtyard, like the one that I was born in
I'm guarded like I'm wounded, my first instinct's always “run”
I wanna turn to steam
I wanna call it off
I wanna lighten the dark
I wanna swallow the sun
I'm laying low
A stray dog in the street
You took me home
We’re sister cities
I'm laying low
A stray dog in the street
You took me home
I was just mange and skin and bone
You took me into your home
Kept warm on a blanket from your worn out winter coat
I'm laying low
A stray dog in the street
You took me home
We’re sister cities
I'm laying low
A stray dog in the street
You took me home
We’re sister cities


Bright blue hydrangeas
Lost in the weeds
Bus stops and barbed wire on the way to stare
At the heart of the earth from the Poas peak
Just like the ones that we grew back in Jersey
Hung upside down, drying out for the wedding
There's a man with his head in his hands on the sidewalk
His wife's there behind him just off of the street
She scratches his back as he sobs on the asphalt
And what strikes me most is the symmetry
How they're framed just like you and me
When the light from the hospital's eastern wing
Tangles up in your hair and the sadness that pooled in my heart
Starts emptying slowly
Well I saw you last night in my dream
And there were hydrangeas where your face should be
The redwoods feel lonely and lunar and distant
The sun comes in fragments through breaks in the trees
And I feel further from home than I've ever been
These thin lines of light across space tether you to me
They pull in my memories, back to our apartment on 2nd Street
Through the South-facing window the light catches lengths of your hair
Like a path that you left me
Well I saw you last night in my dream
But there were azaleas where your face should be
Pieces of us in the morning sun
Sleeping bags under the 101
She takes off his glasses as he falls asleep again
They don't got much but goddamn they got love
Well I saw you last night in my dream
I'm gonna marry you underneath driftwood from Crescent City


I've been thinking a lot about
When the furnace goes
It's the absence of heat that hurts more than the cold
And I got caught in the irony of walking alone
Down an entire block that's just funeral homes and the ground below
Sad and sober Sunday afternoon
Sad and sober Sunday afternoon
You disappear in fragments and phases of the moon
Sad and sober Sunday afternoon
You disappear in fragments and phases of the moon
I watched parts of you dissolve
Turn to ash and then get carried up
I watched your memory fade
Shadows burned into the wall
And no, I felt my lungs turn into atom bombs
Choke on the Florida heat until the oxygen's gone
Sad and sober Sunday afternoon
You disappear in fragments and phases of the moon
Sad and sober Sunday afternoon
You disappear in fragments and phases of the moon
Or an empty room
Or the twelve-bar blues
Or a light in June
You were a bandit, and I was a car wreck
You were the decades on my feet
I was under purple blankets
You were a bandit, and I was a car wreck
You were the rifle on the wall
And it was always going to end
You were a bandit, and I was a car wreck
You were the false rain that falls
From a window AC unit
You were a bandit, and I was a car wreck
You were the rifle on the wall
And it was always going to end like this


I forgot what month it is again
I'm half awake
I know it's wrong but I swear to God it's almost Christmas
In a language I don't understand
There's a shaking voice on the PA
The other passengers seem nervous
I'm playing "What Song Do You Wanna Die To?"
What song do you...
I’m suddenly aware of our speed
Sew the world together tightly
Cinch the gaps with pins and string
And the beacon out there on the wing
It lights the clouds from inside out
And from the ground we look like lightning
I'm playing "What Song Do You Wanna Die To?"
What song do you...
I'm everywhere at once again
I hear the ocean in the engine
I feel the moonlight creeping in
Maybe it's all in my head
An unknown foreign presence in your bloodstream
I'm a stranger in my bed
I'm playing "What Song Do You Wanna Die To?"
"What Song Do You Wanna Die To?"
"What Song Do You Wanna Die To?"
"What Song Do You Wanna Die To?"
What song do you?
I'm flashing back to us one night in a prairie town
(Tornado alley, outrunning a storm)
They can see the dirt there under my fingernails
(I'm just a pile of bones left on an airport floor)
The bags under my eyes have got space when you bottom out
(To pack your things and make a break for the door)
One day the things you love are gonna put you in the ground
(But I'm planning on running 'til I can't run anymore)
What song do you wanna die to?
What song do you wanna die to?
What song do you wanna die to?
What song do you?
What song do you?
What song do you?


I wanna take you someplace safer
Pull your pain out with my teeth
I wanna take away the ulcers burning holes into your cheeks
And I wanna bring you back to water, turn your branches evergreen
I wanna take you someplace safer
I wanna leave
I wanted to see how the light collects in the high desert heat
And you point to where the South Sister should be behind the clouds
I'm haunted by the ghosts of right now
The entire coast is out of water
It's turning different shades of grey
Like watching somebody you love
As they slowly waste away
And you looked skinny at my wedding
Sick of carrying the weight
Of all the doctors and all the treatments and all the reasons to be afraid
I wanted to see how the light collects in the high desert heat
And you point to where the South Sister should be behind the clouds
I'm haunted by the ghosts of right now
The ghosts of right now
I wanna take you someplace safer
I wanna take you someplace safer
I wanted to see how the light collects in the high desert heat
And you point to where the South Sister should be behind the clouds
I'm haunted by the ghosts of right now


Watch the sun burn out and dig itself a grave
In the ocean south of Sydney off the interstate
And I hold out my hand trying not to shake
Watched you jump off of a cliff
And start to levitate
And yeah I'm afraid
But I'll follow you anyway
When the blue finally came
It swallowed up everything
In the sea of trees
I thought that I'd hear ghosts in the waves
When the wind blew through
I heard joy return to a cold and lonesome place
I made out your voice, but I can't ask you to stay
Watched you walk into the woods
And start to levitate
And yeah I'm afraid
But I'll follow you anyway
When the blue finally came
It swallowed up everything


God, take me back to the orange grove
That I found deep in the desert
The air sweet as a miracle
It can't survive but it grows and grows and grows
West Texas is dying slow
An oil rig in the sunset
The air is heavy and filled with smoke
There ain't no quit in the hands that built this home
A dog barks in the distance
Rusted frames take root in the brush
You'll watch it decay
Lie through your teeth and say you'll resurrect a ghost
The paper tigers you made then swore to keep away
You're a knife there at my throat
God, take me back to the orange grove
Fall came quiet and sudden
They're smoking out of their storm doors
Work left town with the summer
We're just trying to keep warm
That cough don't sound any better
Another month, try to push through
Blood in your spit in the morning
Give a fake name at the emergency room
There at the edge of losing everything
Taking desperate swings in the dark
You'll watch it decay
Lie through your teeth and say you'll resurrect a ghost
The paper tigers you made then swore to keep away
You're a knife there at my throat
When your mom got sick so slow
Did you carry the weight alone?
When the bills started to grow
Did you carry the weight alone?
When the bank came for your home
Did you carry the weight alone?
When you reap what they sow
Do you carry the weight alone?
You'll watch it decay
Lie through your teeth and say you'll resurrect a ghost
The paper tigers you made then swore to keep away
You're a knife there at my throat
God, take me back to the orange grove


I stopped making deals with God
Right around when you left
I said that I would start believing
If they made you well again
Guess they knew it was bullshit
Never hold up my end
All the walls are stained in your nicotine
I could feel closing in
I heard somebody cry
I thought I was alone
I came to numb my lungs in the salt air
Let the breakers heal my bones
I wish that the current would carry me home
I've been running for a decade now
And I think I'm ready to go
Oh, I'm ready to go
I stopped making deals with God
When the light finally died
I'm gonna guard what's left of the good in us
When the ash blocks out the sky
And hold you with my left hand
And ball up my right
And if the bastards come for both of us
I'll be right there by your side
I'm by your side
When I was in shambles
When I got too weak
The ocean grew hands to hold me
When I was in shambles
When I got too weak
The ocean grew hands to hold me
I stopped blaming God
When you said you were sick
I learned to lean on the people who love me
When the sutures start to split
I trust in the current to pull you back in
I miss everyone at once
But most of all, I miss the ocean
